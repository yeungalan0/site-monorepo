    % Story time: The curse of consistency
    % We were working on a migration process and as part of the migration we needed
    % this identity (the credential) that was created to have a username, but 
    % it could not match the username on the account. It was failing because of
    % this. For consistency reasons team wanted to use a credential name on a 
    % temp account so wanted to swap the names and that way the migrated account
    % would have the proper credential, but then if we did a rollback we'd have to 
    % unswap. This was complicated, so I suggested instead of needing to be consistent
    % about this username, 1. how much does it matter? 2. Can we just add a suffix
    % the cred username, so it's unique and we don't have to worry about it? This
    % greatly simplified the process and we were able to move forward much faster.
