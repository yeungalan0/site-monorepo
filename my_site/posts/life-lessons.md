# Purpose

This post documents all of the most valuable lessons I've learned throughout my (not yet very long) life.
It's really meant for me to read and remember these lessons into the future,
but I hope others can gain value from this post as well.

## Do your research and know what you want when negotiating

This has rung true many times in my life. I've often tried negotiating without a specific number in mind (or without doing much research),
and just hoped for the other party to slip up and give me the best deal. On rare occasions this works,
but more often than not this leads to a sub-optimal outcome.
The other party may offer me something a little better because I asked,
but it probably won't be nearly as good as what I could have gotten with some research and cajones.

I've had this regret while negotiating my job salary and while negotiating the price of my house.
Asking for something better is definitely a GREAT first step, but knowing and asking specifically for something better is much stronger.
I think my greatest fear is asking for something specific, and then later finding out it was an awful ask.
This is definitely a risk, but proper research should make this a rare event.
Ultimately, after thinking on this issue, I think it's far better to have the specific asking power in your hands,
instead of leaving your fate up to the other party.
Though, maybe save the specific ask till the vary end until you've gotten all you can out of the vague ask.

So in sum, do YOUR RESEARCH and come up with your "magic number" when you intend on negotiating (and you should almost always negotiate),
and it will over the long run lead to better outcomes.
