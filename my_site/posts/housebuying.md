# Purpose

Documents the tips I used during the home buying process,
so that hopefully it will be **significantly** easier for me next time.

# Mortgage shopping

You should **always** shop around for a mortgage loan.
There is almost no downside to doing this,
and it will put you in the best position to get a competitive loan offer.

## Tips

- When you apply for a mortgage and your credit is hard pulled,
  you'll have a ~45 day window to shop around without it dropping your credit anymore,
  so it's best to plan to apply to all your mortgage options during this window
- After you apply for a mortgage and are approved,
  you'll get a legal document known as a loan estimate,
  this is a short legal form with important information about your loan in a standardized format [^1]
  - You should use only these loan estimate documents to compare loans against each other,
    in fact a "comparison" APR number is provided for you to effectively compare loans
  - When the interest rate is locked, the other fees that are controlled by the loan originator can only fluctuate a set amount legally [^2]
- The recommended advice is to call a couple companies to get a feel for the current rates (big company, smaller company, and local credit union),
  then try using a mortgage broker or mortgage aggregation site
- In 2022 I ultimately went with a company found through the Costco mortgage broker site, but [looks like it's been discontinued sadly](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/ug0qcn/the_mortgage_program_for_costco_members_will_no/)
- Whoever you use as your mortgage provider ensure you look up reviews on them to make sure you'll close on time,
  after lending however your mortgage will likely be sold to another provider
- If your builder provides an incentive to use them,
  it may be worth taking your best loan offer to them and seeing if they can match or beat it

## Cons

- Your credit will drop by a few points (temporarily) after you apply for a mortgage and your credit is hard pulled

## Rate locking

- If you are buying a new build or have a long time horizon on your contract and it's currently a volatile rate environment it may be smart to lock in your rate
- Generally the rate can be locked for free about 45 days before closing,
  however there are also 90, 180, and even 270 day plus rate locks which usually cost some money down and probably have a higher APR
- The money down is usually applied towards closing (so is not a fee),
  and guarantees your interest in closing with the lender since they need to put in resources to hedge your lock
  - Do try and make sure the money you pay in the lock will be applied towards closing and is not a fee
- In 2022 I was able to lock a rate for 270 days for .75% of the loan amount (reapplied towards closing),
  and the rate was about ~.375% higher than market at the time

# Inspection

- When buying a new build or any other property, ensure you get an inspection so that you know you're making a sound investment
- For new builds you can get ~3 inspections, 1 before the drywall is up, 1 after you first move in, and 1 final inspection before the 1 year warranty expires

# Misc tips

- Ensure you have records/access to your paystubs for the last year and the last 2 years of your tax returns.
  In fact just keeping good financial records was valuable in this process
- Ensure you have physical checks available as they were valuable in this process
  (for holding your place in a new build line, paying a down payment on a rate lock, etc.)
- Ensure the bank account with your down payment funds allows wire transfers (the typical way to send down payment funds),
  and if it doesn't, transfer your funds well before the closing date
